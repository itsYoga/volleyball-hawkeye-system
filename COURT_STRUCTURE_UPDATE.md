# Volleyball Court Structure Update - FIVB Standards

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive update made to the Volleyball Hawkeye System to fully comply with FIVB (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball) standards. The system now includes all official court elements, proper dimensions, and enhanced boundary checking.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Court Dimensions (Updated to FIVB Standards)

#### Playing Court
- **Dimensions**: 18m × 9m (unchanged, already correct)
- **Center Line**: Divides court into equal halves
- **Line Width**: 5cm (0.05m)

#### Free Zone (New Addition)
- **Sideline Free Zone**: 5m (FIVB World and Official competitions)
- **Endline Free Zone**: 6.5m (FIVB World and Official competitions)
- **Free Playing Space**: 12.5m minimum height (FIVB standards)

#### Net Specifications (Enhanced)
- **Height**: 2.43m (men), 2.24m (women)
- **Width**: 1m
- **Length**: 9.5-10m
- **Antennas**: 80cm above net (new addition)

#### Court Zones (Comprehensive)
- **Attack Lines**: 3m from center line
- **Front Zone**: Between center line and attack lines
- **Back Zone**: Between attack lines and end lines
- **Service Zones**: 9m wide behind end lines
- **Substitution Zone**: Between attack line extensions

### 2. Reference Points (Expanded from 21 to 47 points)

#### New Reference Points Added:
- **Net Antennas**: 2 points (80cm above net)
- **Service Zones**: 4 points (2 per end line)
- **Front Zone Boundaries**: 4 points
- **Back Zone Boundaries**: 4 points
- **Substitution Zones**: 4 points
- **Free Zone Boundaries**: 8 points (4 sidelines, 4 end lines)
- **Height References**: 3 additional points (5m, 7m, 12.5m)

#### Updated Reference Points:
- **Service Zones**: Now properly positioned at end lines (9m wide)
- **Height References**: Extended to include FIVB free playing space limits

### 3. Boundary Checking (Enhanced)

#### Previous Implementation:
- Only checked playing court boundaries (18m × 9m)

#### New Implementation:
- **Playing Court**: 18m × 9m
- **Free Zone**: 5m sidelines, 6.5m end lines
- **Height Limit**: 12.5m (FIVB free playing space)

### 4. 3D Visualization (Enhanced)

#### New Visual Elements:
- **Playing Court Outline**: 18m × 9m rectangle
- **Free Zone Boundary**: Dashed green line showing free zone limits
- **Net and Antennas**: Red lines showing net and antenna positions
- **Attack Lines**: Blue lines at 3m from center
- **Center Line**: Black line dividing court
- **Service Zones**: Yellow lines at end lines

### 5. Configuration Updates

#### hawkeye_config.yaml

  # Free zone dimensions (FIVB standards)
  free_zone_sideline: 5.0    # meters
  free_zone_endline: 6.5     # meters
  free_playing_space: 12.5   # meters
  
  # Court line dimensions
  line_width: 0.05    # meters (5 cm line width)
  attack_line_distance: 3.0  # meters
  
  # Net dimensions
  net_width: 1.0      # meters
  net_length: 9.5     # meters
  antenna_height: 0.8 # meters
  
  # Service zone dimensions
  service_zone_width: 9.0  # meters
  
  # Substitution zone
  substitution_zone_width: 3.0  # meters
```
